The files in this folder are the datasheets/manuals given to us by the kit. Unfortunately, they do not have a more detailed CAD model of the robot. The CAD image was pulled off from their website (https://www.superdroidrobots.com/shop/item.aspx/programmable-mecanum-wheel-vectoring-robot-ig52-db/1788/).

We have also created a github repo, where our C code for controlling the robot through the microcontroller will be placed. (https://github.com/echeng22/BoeingProject)
